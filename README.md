# Counterparty-Credit-Risk-Modeling
* Project developed as part of the MATH-GA-2805 Trends in sell-side modelling XVA, Capital and Credit Derivatives. 
* Survival curves are simulated using Euler-Maruyama algorithm and 2 factors. This prevents the parallel changes in the long term and short term rates and introduces some twists and turns in the curves.
* The exposure graphs mimicing the Sydney Opera house gets its shape due to the fact that at every coupon payment the exposure of the swap reduces slightly and then gets a gradual rise as we move to the next coupon payment.
